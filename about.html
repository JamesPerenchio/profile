    <h2> Brief introduction about myself</h2>
    <p>My name is James and I am from Thailand. I have been in thailand for the better part of my life, (18+ years) and I came to Melbourne, Australia
        to continue my studies. Ever since I was a kid I would mess around with my parents computer and from time to time break things. But I took that as 
        a learning opportunity and I gained a lot of knowledge about computers and mobile devices from those experiences. This made me have a fond loving for 
        computers and new tech as they just seemed interesting to me. I plan on graduating with a Cyber Security degree and want to gain as much experience and 
        exposure in the industry as possible.
    <h2>Education and Certifications</h2>

    <h4>Highschool:</h4>
    I went to highschool at Ruamrudee International School in Thailand. This institution gave me the opportunity to showcase my skills and 
    gave me the opportunity to further learn about what I am interested in. I took the advanced placement (AP) computer science course and international baccalaureate (IB)
    Economics. These two classes were very interesting as it expanded my knowledge in both economics (mainly investing) and computer science. 


    <h4>Higher Education:</h4>
    <p>For my tertiary education, I chose to come to RMIT in Australia to major in IT, more specifically cyber security. I chose cyber security
        because I think it is very important to be aware of the various threats and ways to stay safe online, especially in the digital age that we are living in.
        I completed my diploma in IT at RMIT and I learned a lot about computers. The most notable ones are:
        <ul>
            <li>&#x2022 Managing virtual machines</li>
            <li>&#x2022 Managing Active Directory using Microsoft Server</li>
            <li>&#x2022 Managing and designing databases using SQL</li>
            <li>&#x2022 How to connect, operate, and manage Cisco routers and switches</li>
            <li>&#x2022 Creating a dynamic website that updates its information/data using a database.</li>
        </ul>
        These courses were very fun to do and they taught me a lot of new things about computers. They have provided me with a lot of valuable skills 
        that I still use in my everyday life. I am currently in my second year and doing an Associates degree in IT as I still want to learn more about this area.
        <br>
        <p>During this time, I am completing as many modules and tasks as possible in <a href="https://academy.hackthebox.com/.">Hackthebox</a> This website is amazing as it is teaching me a lot of things I previously
            did not know about Linux and windows, and it is teaching me a lot about all the other methods of attacking and defending against cyber attacks.

    <h2>What got me hooked</h2>
    <h3>IT and computer science </h3>
    <p>When thailand was still using ADSL for their internet connections, I remember getting regular internet outages and it got me frustrated. I would 
        often get disconnected from online games or having very high ping/latency, putting me at a disadvantage. I also did not grow up in the 
    richest household so the family's computer often times had problems running games and was very slow as my parents were not very technology oriented. 
I felt like I had to take things into my own hands and whenever there was a problem I would often times be the first to fix it and find ways to prevent it.
Since I wasnt using a very powerful computer, It would often times lag when playing modern games as it could not handle the graphics requirements. I did not know what 
any of the options meant; Things such as anti aliasing filter, ping, loss (in and out), and so on. Since I was curious about these things and wanted to know how to fix it and be able to 
play my game smoothly, I did a lot of research about them. I may not be able to tell someone in great detail how it works, but I can do a brief explanation and most importantly how to resolve the issue
if there ever is one. 
<h3>Economics and investing</h3>
<p>When it comes to Economics and investing, I was curious how money moves around and what makes the world (in terms of finance) works. Taking an IB course in economics 
    expanded my knowledge by a lot and made me more more enthusiastic about the area. I learned how to invest 100% by myself as I believe that it is a vital 
    skill to have in this day and age. I also had a lot of free time and had nothing to do (games were getting boring). I also wanted to find another 
    outlet for making money, even if it wasnt a lot, it is still better than nothing. I learned about investing, trading, all the different terms, and the optimal ways to invest in each asset, 
    whether it be government bonds, stocks, Mutual funds, and ETF's. I have made a positive return on most of my investments and I feel like I have learned a lot just by utilizing
    Investopedia and youtube, most importantly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ThePlainBagel">The Plain Bagel</a>, who simplifies a lot of the key concepts into concepts that are easy to understand.
